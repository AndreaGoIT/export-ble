# export-ble

## Short application description

The solution provides a basic Bluetooth LE driver developed as a C# Xamarin Android Class Library. The class detects if the Bluetooth is enabled or not, starts and stops a LE scan, returns the MAC address of the found devices.

Then the .DLL library should be converted in .AAR using the external tool Embeddinator-4000.

Finally the .AAR library is testable in the Android application **HelloBleCSharp**.

## Getting Started

* The Android test application **ExportBleCSharp** is developed in Android Studio 3.3.
