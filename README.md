# export-ble

## Short application description

The solution provides a basic Bluetooth LE driver developed in a C# Xamarin Android Class Library. 
The class detects if the Bluetooth is enabled or not, starts and stops a LE scan, returns the MAC address of the found devices._
Then the .DLL library should be converted in .AAR using the external tool Embeddinator-4000._
Finally the .AAR library is testable in the Android application **HelloBleCSharp**._

## Getting Started

* The Android test application **HelloBleCSharp** is developed in Android Studio 3.3.
* The Xamarin Android library **hello-ble-csharp** is developed in Visual Studio 2017
